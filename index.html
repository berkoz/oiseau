        <p>A <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> scrobbler for <a href="http://www.musicpd.org/">Music Player Daemon</a>, written in Python.</p>

<p>Quoting <a href="http://cmende.github.io/scmpc/">scmpc</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”Another one?”, I hear you cry? Yes, I know about mpdscribble, but when I started this project it didn’t do entirely what I wanted it to. It didn’t run as a daemon, for example, and it didn’t work if you enable crossfading in MPD. I didn’t add the support for these in mpdscribble, partly because GNU coding style scares me, and I got slightly lost in the source code, but also because I created this as a way of teaching myself C programming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote oiseau because scmpc submitted multiple instances of a song to Last.fm. The "keeping unsubmitted songs in a queue saved to a file" feature didn't really work in scmpc. Originally, I wanted to write oiseau in C, but I didn't want to use glib, and I realized that it would make the experience extremely difficult (seeing as there isn't too much examples of programs which use libmpdclient and not glib)</p>
