Yes, I know about mpdscribble, but when I started this project it didn’t do entirely what I wanted it to. It didn’t run as a daemon, for example, and it didn’t work if you enable crossfading in MPD. I didn’t add the support for these in mpdscribble, partly because GNU coding style scares me, and I got slightly lost in the source code, but also because I created this as a way of teaching myself C programming.\r\n\r\nI wrote oiseau because scmpc submitted multiple instances of a song to Last.fm. The \"keeping unsubmitted songs in a queue saved to a file\" feature didn't really work in scmpc. Originally, I wanted to write oiseau in C, but I didn't want to use glib, and I realized that it would make the experience extremely difficult (seeing as there isn't too much examples of programs which use libmpdclient and not glib)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Scrobbling (obviously)\r\n* Updates \"Now Playing\" on Last.fm when it can\r\n* No duplicate scrobbles (almost guaranteed)\r\n* Waits for a portion of the song to be finished before scrobbling\r\n* Can set \"scrobble after N tracks\"\r\n* Can cache tracks for later scrobbling\r\n* Configuration file\r\n* Run as a daemon\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nInstallation is relatively easy. Get the source from any of the links below, and run `python setup.py install` with the sufficent privileges. Then create a configuration file and you are ready to use oiseau.\r\n\r\nFor further information, see **README.rst**.\r\n\r\nSource\r\n------\r\n\r\n* The latest source tarball is available here: [/oiseau-0.1.0.tar.gz][tarball]\r\n* Git repository: [GitHub][github]\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to get involved, if you have found any bugs, or if you have any feature requests, please open a [new issue][issue] in GitHub.\r\n\r\n[lastfm]: http://www.last.fm/\r\n[mpd]: http://www.musicpd.org/\r\n[scmpc]: http://cmende.github.io/scmpc/\r\n[tarball]: https://github.com/bozbalci/oiseau/archive/oiseau-v0.1.0.tar.gz\r\n[github]: https://github.com/bozbalci/oiseau/\r\n[issue]: https://github.com/bozbalci/oiseau/issues",
